# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains solutions for "Advent of Code" made mostly in Python.
I'll try to experiment and solve the tasks in other languages for the sake of
experiment. The initial version will be always Python in order to provide the
solution fast. Then the logic will be translated in other languages to see
how it will look like.

In the repo I will add only the test data. The actual inputs will not be uploaded.
If someone want's to try it out then they need to download the input for the
desired day and name it as follows `<year>/day<number>-input.txt`.
